This is my assembly language (8088 architecture) project made with my teamate @SultanAhmad7560.

The idea behind the project includes implementing sub-routines,string instructions,DOS/BIOS services,interrupts and multi-tasking.

The instructions on how to play are given inside the game.

Pledgerism is highly discouraged and is recommended that if you're a student you should only take help from this or you can reach out to me as well.
